This library draws heavily on the work by Mike Grusin of Sparkfun Electronics.
The original license text of that work follows:

    SFE_BMP180.h
    Bosch BMP180 pressure sensor library for the Arduino microcontroller
    Mike Grusin, SparkFun Electronics

    Uses floating-point equations from the Weather Station Data Logger project
    http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/
    http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/Arduino/BMP085-Calcs.pdf

    Forked from BMP085 library by M.Grusin

    version 1.0 2013/09/20 initial version
    Verison 1.1.2 - Updated for Arduino 1.6.4 5/2015
    
    Our example code uses the "beerware" license. You can do anything
    you like with this code. No really, anything. If you find it useful,
    buy me a (root) beer someday.
